							<li>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in <b>1960</b>, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist. He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.</li>

							<li>In <b>1969</b>, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July <b>1980</b>; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in <b>1965</b>.</li>

							<li>In <b>1969</b>, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.</li>

							<li>In <b>1963</b> to <b>1964</b>, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility. Between the <b>1970</b>s and <b>1990</b>s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.</li>

							<li>Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the <b>1970</b>s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme.</li>

							<li>In <b>1998</b>, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju Stent".In <b>2012</b>, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet"</li>

							<li>Kalam served as the 11th President of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the <b>2002</b> presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July <b>2002</b> to 25 July <b>2007</b>.</li>

							<li>On 10 June <b>2002</b>, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President, and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy. After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear. Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature:<br><br>

							    "I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a message. I was thinking what message I can give to the people of the country at this juncture."</i></div></center>
							</li>

							<li>On 18 June <b>2012</b>, Kalam declined to contest the <b>2012</b> presidential poll. He said of his decision not to do so:<br><br>
							<i>
							    Many, many citizens have also expressed the same wish. It only reflects their love and affection for me and the aspiration of the people. I am really overwhelmed by this support. This being their wish, I respect it. I want to thank them for the trust they have in me.</i>
							</li><br>

							<li>On 27 July <b>2015</b>, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest.At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m IST. His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: <i>"Funny guy! Are you doing well?"</i></li>
